I've been learning Spanish now for about four years and i've found it such a rewarding experience. I discovered I was happiest when Im studying something, which is one one the reasons I decide to learn how to code, I knew that just like learning a language, I would never be "done". 

I clearly remember feeling like a frustrated child during my first few weeks of both learning Spanish and coding, knowing what idea I wanted to to express but not having the ability yet to get it across. Its so incredibly frustrating not only not knowing how to do something, but also not knowing the built in methods and shortcuts to be able to research them in the first place!

It's all building slowly though, as is my ability to be able to phrase something in a way that I can find out if what im looking for even exists in the first place. Just like with Spanish, its so much better to at least try and speak out loud and get it wrong, than to constantly just keep playing it safe with what you know works.

It’s the equivalent of learning basic vocabulary in a foreign language, it will get you so far, but you need to experiment with tenses and grammar before you can make your sentences more complex. Sometimes I stumble upon things written in a different programming language to the one I'm learning, but you can make a bit of sense out of them by seeing them from the point of view of the one you are learning.

People say that once you’ve learned one foreign language, it's much easier and faster to pick up others, so I'm really hoping this applies with programming languages too. I keep reminding myself that im learning how to code, generally not trying to master a specific language, its fine to look stuff up if I don't know exactly/can't remeber something!
