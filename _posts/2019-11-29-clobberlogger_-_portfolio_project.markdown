I really found it helpful to use the Corneal gem in order to help me set up my file structure.  I did several test runs without it, but it was much much easier with it! It helps by  generating the model, controller and views and folder structure for me and populating some of it with sample files.

From this I was able to create the migrations that i needed to set up my database, and then create the models that I needed. Having 5 models for this application took a bit of trial and error in terms of the associations, so I had to play about with it in tux first before i started building the routes and views. 

I found that some of my controllers had to many methods in them, so i created another model called helper methods in which to keep them to make it tidier overall and to keep things seperated.

Whilst building, i inspected params very frequently in order to make sure that my forms were all labelled corrected, and i used binding.pry to debug as I went along. I struggled a lot with the styling but I feel that it is something I can come back to once ive had a bit more practice at it and make it look much better!

I really enjoyed this project, and once I got going, I found I worked quite methodically, creating a route and checking it worked first before linking it up to an erb file, then filling in the erb with some sample words to check that that was working before moving on etc.

Very happy with how its all working!
