Hi, I'm Lindsey, 

I work full time as a studio camera operator and its a career I enjoyed for many years, but the pathways are all closing now as more jobs are being given over to automation and robotically controlled cameras and for the last few years I have been enjoying it less and less as lack of variety and shift work have taken it out of me.

Since having my baby daughter nearly two years ago, and discovering a love of learning languages  whilst on maternity leave, I came to realise that I could put this ability to immerse myself in learning to an amazing use and attempt a complete career change into software design and programming. After seeing some big pushes at my workplace to encourage women into tech jobs I looked more into it and completed the bootcamp prep with Flatiron School to see if it was for me, and I loved it.

When I started back at work again full-time I realised that the timing in my life was perfect to try to start a change in career, to one where I have to think for myself, figure things out and take responsibility for my progress rather than just being told what to do by a director talking in my ear. I started to resent my actual job even more, as I felt like it was "stealing" my time away from what I actually wanted to be doing, learning to code!

My original plan was to complete the self-paced program before work and during my lunch-breaks, aiming to complete it at about the 15-20 hours a week pace if I could keep it up, fully expecting to take the full 15 months if needed, then look for a new job, only leaving my current one when the right job come along, no pressure.

However...
my work has just announced voluntary redundancies with pretty generous payouts, if I volunteer, I could afford to take up to 9 months off to study the program full-time at home and obviously get through it much much faster and spend more time with my family. The only issue with this is that I am at this point only 1 WEEK into the Full Stack programme! I'm enjoying it very much so far, but obviously I have no idea at this point if this is definately the right career move for me, and even whether i'd be any good at it. Its such a huge risk and I wasn't expecting to have to make such a big decision so early on in the process. I have a meeting in two days to give them my decision....
